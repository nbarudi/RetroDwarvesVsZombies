## Note:

(Disclaimer: Since classes started Development will be delayed until my schedule opens up)

### This is an outdated version of the RDvZ Project! The majority of this code was quickly thrown together to make the gamemode function as fast as possible.
### If your intent is to copy this code and use it for your own games, use it at your own risk. It will not be updated any farther as it is far too inefficient to be useful as far as I am concerned
### If you would like to see a more updated version of this game (Generally cleaner code / more efficent design) you can find a more recent version [Here](https://github.com/nbarudi/RDvZRevamped)
### As well I would like to note. Both this project and the revamped versions are more passion projects then actual projects. I work on them durring my spare time and as school has become a large factor in what I do, development as slowed down largely.
